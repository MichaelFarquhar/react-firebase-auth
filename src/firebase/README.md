# Firebase

After creating a new firebase project and setting up an app, you will recieve code that looks similar to the `firebase=config.js` file.

To keep our firebase credentials safe, we will extract the properties from firebaseConfig object into an .env file.

1. Duplicate `.env.example` and name it `.env.local`.
2. Copy the properties you recieved from firebase into the appropriate environment variables.

### useFirebaseError.ts
